1. DRIVER
    application scoped.
    thread safe

2. SESSION (StatementRunner)
    NOT thread safe
    LOW COST CREATION (pool)
    they wrap a tcp connection

    2 types of transacionts: Transaction object (explicit) --- run()



3. TRANSACTION (ALSO statementRunner)
    close() Closing the transaction will complete it - it will commit if success() has been called.




=================================   RESULTS ===================================

StatementResult: This is an Iterator<Record> with methods like
    hasNext(),
    next()/peek()
    keys() ???



Record: Container for Cypher result values.
            Supports getters with default values!


Value
    A unit of data that adheres to the Neo4j type system.
    Kind of like a json object.
    Cool tools for navigating, iterating ect.
    isString, isNode to check types
    asString, asNode etc to get the java types.
    also getters with default values!

Node implements Entity
    can be retrieved from a Value.
    it has its own values: Iterable<Values>
    values(), keys(), containsKey(String)
    id(),
    hasLabel(), labels()


Relationship implements Entity
   can be retrieved from a Value.
       it has its own values: Iterable<Values>
       values(), keys(), containsKey(String)
       id(),
       hasType(), type(), startNodeId(), endNodeId()
